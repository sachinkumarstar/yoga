                <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: 500;font-size: 18px;">Mantra yoga is one of the 6 branches of
                    yoga which includes chanting of potential syllables, verses,
                    or Vedic hymns to attain one of the limbs of yoga, i.e. Pratyahara. Like other forms of yoga, the
                    aim of mantra yoga is to attain ultimate salvation.
                    <br> <br>
                    Getting into the terminology of “Mantra Yoga”, divides it into two words, “Mantra” and “Yoga” which
                    are intradisciplinary aspects. This is so because mantra and yoga complement each other and that is
                    the main intention behind this practice.
                    <br> <br>
                    Yoga is practiced to unite with the supreme soul and that’s only possible if you can control the
                    wandering of mind and reach higher states of consciousness. This is achieved through chanting and
                    repeating the mantra over and over again, similarly, chanting is performed only with the same
                    intention of yoga.

                    The origin of Mantra Yoga has been traced back to Vedas and tantra. Facts predict that yoga actually
                    came into being in the form of mantra yoga. The primary teachings of it are mentioned in the Rig
                    Veda. <br><br>

                    Mantra Yoga is much more than a spiritual practice as the science behind it makes a contribution to
                    ancient enlightened sages of Sanatana Dharma. Since each verse or hymn in the Vedas has a unique
                    vibration that echoes with the sounds of universal consciousness which leads the practitioner to
                    divinity. <br><br>
                    Originally, Mantra yoga was adapted in Hinduism, however, religions Buddhism and Jainism have also
                    adapted to it to reach enlightenment. <br> <br>

                    As it was mentioned earlier that in mantra yoga, certain syllable or verse is repeated over and over
                    again to deepen and catalyze the practice of yoga. This process of repeating the mantra is known as
                    Japa, hence, mantra yoga sometimes also referred to as Japa Yoga.

                <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: 500;font-size: 18px;">The five basic requirements of a Mantra are described below that include Rishi (Seer), Chhanda
                    (meter), Devta (deity), Bija (seed), and Tattva (element).</p>
                <ol
                    style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: 500;font-size: 18px;">
                    <li>Rishi (Seer) – The seer or sage is the ancient spiritual teacher who discovered the mantra for
                        the first time by hearing or realizing the sounds in higher consciousness. The sage then becomes
                        a medium who passes the mantra to further followers in the world.</li>
                    <li>Chhanda (meter) – A meter is something that describes the pronunciation, rhythm, and the way of
                        recitation to please the deity associated with that mantra. Hence every mantra is prepared
                        traditionally with a specific meter associated with it.</li>
                    <li>Devta (deity) – Each mantra has a specific deity presiding over it who is called upon through
                        the chanting. The practitioner by chanting the mantra attracts and assimilates the consciousness
                        and qualities of the presiding deity.</li>
                    <li>Bija (seed) – Bija is an essence of the mantra which grants special power to it. It is the seed
                        of a mantra that enables the stimulation of the energy centers located in the human body.
                        Therefore, bija is an essential element to see the fruition of the mantra.</li>
                    <li>Tattva (element) – An element is a key to unlock the intended results behind the mantra. It can
                        be understood by the fact that every mantra possesses the nature of a five-elements and one of 3
                        gunas (such as Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas).</li>

                    Just like in Patanjali’s Yoga there 8 limbs which lead to Samadhi, there are 16 limbs of Mantra yoga
                    knowing which is essential to get fruitful results from this practice.

                    The 16 limbs of mantra yoga are – Bhakti, Shudhi, Asana, Panchang Sevan, Achara, Dharna, Divyadesh
                    Sevan, Prana Kriya, Mudra, Tarpana, Havan, Bali, Yaga, Japa, Dhayana, and Samadhi.

                    A clear idea describing all the limbs are given below to make the concept easier for the
                    practitioner, so let’s begin:</p>

                        that’s
                        what bhakti denotes. It is impossible to manifest mantra yoga without having complete and
                        unshakable faith over the practice.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Shudhi </b> – Shudi refers to purification, which in yoga mantra means internal cleansing of
                        body,
                        mind, and spirit. Also, the place dedicated to the practice and the intention behind it must be
                        pure as well. </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b> Asana </b> – Asana refers to the posture that the practitioner attains while practicing
                        mantra yoga.
                        It also denotes the seat on which the yogi sits like woolen, kusha, Resham, Mriga-charma,
                        baghambar, blanket, etc. are considered preferable stuff to sit on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Panchang Sevan </b> – It is the collection of Gita, Sahasranam, Stuti, Kavach, and

                    To practice mantra yoga, the important step is to draw honesty (Satya) into the practice that
                    signifies the dedication of the practitioner. <br>

                    Another thing that has to be there before starting the chant is to surrender in the mantra which can
                    be done by trusting in the practice. It is the faith in the practice that leads to the intended
                    results which seem far beyond one’s potential.
                    <br>
                    After honesty and faith within yoga mantra, the following procedure can be followed to implement the
                    practice:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-weight: 500;font-size: 18px;">
                    <li>
                        Find a comfortable place that is away from any distractions or disturbances to practice seated
                        meditation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Choose your mantra and then sit quietly for a moment contemplating your intentions with a
                        conviction.</li>
                    <li>Inhale deeply and then while exhaling recite your mantra as naturally as it rhymes with the
                        exhalation.</li>
                    <li>Take another deep breath and repeat the mantra and feel the moment organically.</li>
                    <li>On the third repetition, recollect the intention behind the particular mantra that you are
                        chanting.</li>
                    <li>On the fourth repetition, you need to relax the mind and body and feel the sound of the mantra.
                    </li>
                    <li>On the next repetition, let the chant happen automatically with the flow where you don’t utter
                        it forcibly.</li>
                    <li>Repeat again and again combining all the elements together focusing on the sound and meaning of
                        the mantra and easing your expectations.</li>
                    <li>Keep chanting for about 30 rounds or until you calm the mind within the practice.</li>
                    <li>Sit in complete silence for a while that you have generated with the chant cleansing the nervous
                        system.</li>

                    Alternatively, mantra yoga can also be done in a group aka Sangh wherein one leader introduces the

                        sutra and its resonating sound. It removes undesirable thoughts, stabilizes the mind to reach

                    <li>Low-pitched Chanting – It is a way of mantra yoga that is audible to the practitioner only as
                        the chant is vague that only involves lip-movement while recitation.</li>
                    <li>Mental Chanting – Here, the mantra is chanted silently in the mind without actually uttering it

                        offense, or sins that incurred to mind accidentally, then such chanting is known as atonement
                        chanting.</li>

                        eating, sleeping keeping the tongue and lips in motion. It can also use a garland that also

                        the chant occurs in a flow just like breathing. Therefore, such chant takes place as long as
                        there is prana or breath in the body.</li>
                    <li>Bhramar chanting – Here, the mantra chanting is done imitating the humming of a bee.</li>

                        grove. So, the chanting that is practiced while doing the pradakshina is known as pradakshina
                        chanting.</li>
                    <li>Prohibited Chanting – When someone intends to harm others or chant with an impure intention that
                        doesn’t have any rhythm or is very intense, then it is prohibited chanting. Such chanting is
                        totally fruitless.</li>
